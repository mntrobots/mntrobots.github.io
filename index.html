										<p>When we made are race car it was quite hard to find out how to make the base where we put the EV3 brick. When all that was done we started to decorate our car. We made some nice looking creations. After that we did a little bit of batteling with are cars. Sometimes our cars broke so then we had to fix it, after 20 minutes we upgraded it and put cool stuff and defence.</p>

										<p>When we made the crane, it was okay to build and program. We took about one day to build it cause we had all the pieces but there was a diffrent group that took one day and a half to make the whole thing, when it was finished it looked alot like R2D2 from Star wars. When we finished it we had no clue what to do. The teacher told us to start program the crane but there was only twenty minutes left until were going.</p>

										<p>On day three we started programing the other group were only halfway on finishing there robot. Programing was quite hard and we didnt even know how to program it that way, the teacher told us to copy somebodys off the internet that has been used to program a crane.We tapt to play and it did not work with ours. When the lesson nearly ended a teacher asked us if we would like to be on TV and we said yes. Then we saw a person with a big TV camera he came to the room we worked in the presentator asked us some questions and helped us to program it. Its the first time we ever had been on TV.

										<p>When we came back we started building a race cource to race our cars, we used:Markers, scissors, card board from Fed Ex and tape to build the race cource.Of course we needed to build cars for the race track'so we decided to build a tank that we named the rage monster. We didn't race yet cause we had not much time to begin the racee cause we had to connect it to our phone otherwise it can't move. </p>

										<p>On day 5 we started making a website. We also had to start connecting to the rage monster [the tank we built on day four]. Today a little bit went wrong the wright wheel didn't start moving, so we had to find out why it was not moving. And then we tread the demo but it still did not work. But then we changed the wire from D to C and then it worked and the tank was moving to make the . In the website we had to add in images and write down alot of sentences Eplaining the robot. After that were going to start presentations.
